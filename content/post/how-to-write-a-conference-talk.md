First and foremost, *don't start with the slides!*

<!--more-->

Start with the outline.

An outline is the most important part of any story and any presentation is just another story. You need structure, a flow, and a plan. *Always start with an outline*.

My outline template started after a training from Bold Echo, a company specializing in training public speakers. It’s been adapted over the years for the way that I use it and I’m sharing it in case it might be helpful to you. You can copy the [conference outline google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vkoUMHrNav6_m1f-xIDJDoT5hMaS5x765IIlzo8inkI/edit) so it is in easy scratchpad form.

## Speaking Goal

Before you journey down the path of giving a talk in front of people, make sure you have a clear goal that resonates with you. You can use a structure like the following to help direct you towards a suitable goal.

> After my presentation is over, I want my audience to **[ ... ]** so that **[ ... ]**

Be grand yet specific, general talks are very boring. Your goal is the backbone of your presentation and needs to have substance that leads to action and inspiration.

After you have your goal, break it down into 5 major parts:

## 1) The Introduction

The introduction is for easing the crowd into your viewpoint by gaining trust and clearly outlining your direction.

#### Grab attention

Bring them in with something relevant, topical, or funny. This is your hook and keeps people from leaving your talk after a snap judgement that it's not worth it. You start gaining trust or losing it here. Once you have this solidified, practice it out loud until there's no way it could go wrong.

#### Gather interest

What’s in it for your audience? What’s the agenda, what is your audience in store for? Respect your audience’s time and let them know if this talk is going to touch on what they want to hear.

#### Establish Credibility

Why should your audience pay attention to you? People might not know who you are and, even if they do, they might not know why you are relevant to the topic you are speaking about. Are you a practitioner? How long have you been doing this?

#### Provide clarity

Focus the points in the introduction and lead into the transition.

## 2-4) Outline your 3 Key Points

This is the meat of your presentation and where you spend the most of your time. You don't need to overdo the definition in the outline, but you need to have enough to be confident in your content. This section will grow or shrink the most depending on the length of time you're expecting to fill.

#### The transition

Sketch our your transition from the introduction and to each of the subsequent key points. These transitions are critical to maintain flow and keep your audience together.

#### Description

Flesh out the description for each key point.

#### Supporting material

List out 3 pieces of supporting material that strengthen your key point. If you can't support your points sufficiently then it may be that you need to rethink how your story is laid out.

## 5) The Conclusion

You've kept your audience through the introduction and your key points, the conclusion is where you wrap it up cleanly and leave your audience satisfied and motivated.

#### Signal the end

Review your key points briefly. This is how you signal that your talk is ending and that you are in the process of tying everything together.

#### Reiterate central message

Reinforce the message that you want everyone to take away from your talk.

#### Provide a call to action

What should your audience do next? Now that you’ve enlightened them, what is the next step? 

BE SPECIFIC! What can people do *now*?

#### Provide a clincher

Make a huge impact. The emotion here is what people will walk away with.

## Now start your slides

Start your slides in the same way you started your outline. Break it out into the key portions and add content that fits the flow of your outline. Remember: your outline is key, don't get married to your slides.

Hope this is useful to you! Before you submit proposals, you should go through and fill out at least the goal and the key points to ensure your mind is thinking about the flow of a talk first. Titles and abstracts are fine, but most reviewers have gotten to the point of understanding that a good abstract is nearly completely unrelated to whether or not the talk itself will be good. The best talks are the ones that are practiced and prepared, and an outline is the first step in preparing.
