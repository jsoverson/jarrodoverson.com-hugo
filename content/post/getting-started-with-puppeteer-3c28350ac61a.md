Iâ€™ve started making video!

<img style='max-width:100%;' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1280/1*8AwM0yHze1Q8QJVqaIR-aA.png">

The first video here acts as essentially an introduction to Puppeteer, using NPM to install it, and some of its basic features. Iâ€™ll be building off this with a lot more advanced content hopefully week by week.

If you have any feedback, please comment or message me on twitter at jsoverson. So far I:

<li>Need to make shorter videos</li>
<li>Need to have a better background</li>
<li>Need a better camera/lighting</li>
<li>Need to decouple the camera from the table so I donâ€™t shake it ðŸ˜£</li>

Iâ€™m getting thereâ€¦
