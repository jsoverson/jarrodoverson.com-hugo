JavaScript Particle System
====================

HTML5 Canvas Particle System with gravity fields
---------------------

Libraries and interactive sandbox html page.

Can programmatically set up a particle system for use in other
projects. The sandbox page is mostly for the whiz-bang factor and to
show off capabilities without any user investment.

***How to install locally***
----------------------------
To run the sandbox page on your local machine, it needs to run on a web server.

The sandbox html page is dependent on the LessCSS javascript library which
does its own magic to generate the CSS. Due to most browser's security models
a page can't make ajax requests against a file system so you need to be running
over http.
